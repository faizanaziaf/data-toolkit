        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python; it's efficient for handling large arrays and matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by expanding them implicitly to match.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "A DataFrame is a 2D labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas.\n",
        "The groupby() method is used to group data based on keys and perform aggregate operations like sum, mean, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "Seaborn offers high-level functions for creating attractive and informative statistical plots with fewer lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n",
        "NumPy arrays are faster, support vectorized operations, and consume less memory than Python lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "A heatmap is a 2D visualization showing data intensity using color; it's used to visualize correlation matrices and data density.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
        "It refers to applying operations on whole arrays without using loops, which boosts performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "Matplotlib is static and traditional, while Plotly is interactive and web-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",
        "It allows multiple index levels (multi-indexing), enabling complex data structures and more flexible data selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?\n",
        "It plots pairwise relationships in a dataset, useful for visualizing distributions and correlations.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "It provides summary statistics like mean, std, min, max, and quartiles for numerical columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "Missing data can skew analysis; handling it ensures data integrity and accurate insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
        "Plotly offers interactive, web-friendly, and customizable visualizations with minimal code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "NumPy uses ndarray objects that can have any number of dimensions (axes).\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?\n",
        "Bokeh is used for creating interactive, web-ready plots with large and streaming datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas.\n",
        "apply() works on rows/columns of DataFrames; map() is used element-wise on Series.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "Advanced features include broadcasting, linear algebra functions, FFT, and masked arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?\n",
        "Pandas supports date indexing, resampling, rolling windows, and time zone handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?\n",
        "Pivot tables reshape data for aggregation and summarization, like Excel pivot tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?\n",
        "NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory and use optimized C-based operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What are some common use cases for Seaborn?\n",
        "Seaborn is used for visualizing distributions, correlations, categorical data, and regression plots."
